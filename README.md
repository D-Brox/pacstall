# test-pacstall
just a test of a package managment thingy like portage but this is cross compatible
pacstall should search for packages in this directory and install it with sudo pacstall -I <package>
  
Only works with tar.xz and tar.gz files (for now). tar.xz has been tested to work but not tar.gz so use with caution.
THIS IS ALPHA SOFTWARE AND NOT MEAN'T TO BE USED FOR INSTALLING PACKAGES
